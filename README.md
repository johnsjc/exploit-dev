# exploit-development

My notes and code related to everything exploit development.

### Exploit Development Steps

#### 1. Control EIP
- Where is my buffer? (Does any register point to it?)

#### 2. Determine Attack Vector
- Are there any exploit mitigations in place? (NX, ASLR, Stack Canaries, PIE, RELRO)
- Ret2any (stack, data/heap, text, libraries (libc), ROP gadgets)
- Stack pivoting

#### 3. Build the exploit
- Shellcode
- Ret2any payload

#### 4. Test
- Bad characters (patch with equivalent opcodes)
- Runtime effects/changes (environment variables, platform, offsets, etc.)
