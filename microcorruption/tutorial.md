## 1. Tutorial


**Objective**: Reading MSP430 assembly


```
4484: <check_password>
4484:  6e4f           mov.b	@r15, r14
4486:  1f53           inc	r15
4488:  1c53           inc	r12
448a:  0e93           tst	r14
448c:  fb23           jnz	#0x4484 <check_password+0x0>
```

- r15 is the register that holds the memory address where our inputted password is stored.
- This is a loop that steps through each character in our inputted password by incrementing the address stored in r15. 
- Each character is stored in r14, and tested for the presence of the null byte (indicating the string has terminated.) 
- Each iteration, a counter in r12 is incremented which indicates the length of the password (including the null terminator).

```
448e:  3c90 0900      cmp	#0x9, r12
4492:  0224           jeq	#0x4498 <check_password+0x14>
4494:  0f43           clr	r15
4496:  3041           ret
4498:  1f43           mov	#0x1, r15
449a:  3041           ret
```

- The hardcoded value 0x9 is compared with r12.
- If r12 is 9 (i.e. the password is 8 characters long) the jump is taken and r15 is set to 1.
- Otherwise, the jump is **not** taken, and r15 is cleared.

In **main**, we can see that for the door to be unlocked, r15 must be nonzero. That is, the jump at 0x4492 must be taken. For that to happen, the password must be exactly 8 characters long.
```
444c:  b012 8444      call	#0x4484 <check_password>
4450:  0f93           tst	r15
4452:  0520           jnz	#0x445e <main+0x26>
4454:  3f40 c744      mov	#0x44c7 "Invalid password; try again.", r15
4458:  b012 5845      call	#0x4558 <puts>
445c:  063c           jmp	#0x446a <main+0x32>
445e:  3f40 e444      mov	#0x44e4 "Access Granted!", r15
4462:  b012 5845      call	#0x4558 <puts>
4466:  b012 9c44      call	#0x449c <unlock_door>
```

**Flag:** **password**
